# 2022-09-25 Bill makes a mistake

Today, through my own negligence removed all the content from the
  `Massive-Wiki/massive-wiki-starter` Github repository.

I believe I have restored what was there; further use will provide a check of that. And in the acts of making this mistake and making repairs I have learned how easy it is to confuse what belongs to a group from what is my own content. At least there are lessons that can be learned -- time will tell.
