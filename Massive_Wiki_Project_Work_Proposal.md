# Massive Wiki Project Work Proposal
  - This wiki page is [[People/Bill Anderson|Bill Anderson]]'s initial description (2023-07-23)

### Massive Wiki project development goals

The next steps in Massive Wiki development are divided, for now, into two categories.  
1. Documenting how to establish and use a Massive Wiki to support and facilitate information or personal knowledge management (PKM) task or tasks. This entails:
	- adopting wiki content creating applications, and
	- establishing work practices that suit the project, including managing versions of shared content  
 2. Documenting how to publish a Massive Wiki to the Internet. This procedure (and its associated practices) are supported today with MassiveWikiBuilder (MWB) software, available on Gihub: <https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massivewikibuilder>  

TODO:  
- write Massive Wiki work plans for each step; prioritize the specified work tasks  
- clarify and describe goals, commitments, and, if needed, resource requirements and risks  
- one primary task: determine our commitment for wider distribution and the associated support work
