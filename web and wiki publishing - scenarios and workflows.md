# web and wiki publishing - scenarios and workflows


### scenarios from [[MasWiki Python Module meeting, 2024-01-30]]  

**Use Cases, Personas:**  
1. I'm installing MasWiki because I want to turn Obsidian vaults into websites -> install MasWiki
    - "website" - does that mean local? cloud? both?
    - "install MasWiki" -- globally, or with a venv
2. I want a quick and easy website (and a static site is okay) -> install Publishing Toolkit

### the three web/wiki publishing scenarios (2024-01-31: BA)
  - establish a new wiki, or document, repository AND website  
  - add a website to existing document (or wiki) repository  
  - add a website and repository to an existing document collection
