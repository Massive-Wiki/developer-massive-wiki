# Why Massive Wiki

Why you might use a Massive Wiki:

1. You have a collection of texts, notes, documents, etc., about a topic, a task, or a project that you want to share with others, and manage the changes that are made.
2. You want this collection to be available to others, online or off.
3. You want to publish the collection, or part of it, to the Web.
