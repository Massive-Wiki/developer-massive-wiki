# Git GUI Clients

(Pete is making some sample edits here.)



A Git GUI client is a graphical application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Git version control system. It helps users manage their repositories, visualize commit history, branches, and other Git-related tasks without having to use the command line.

Alternatives to a GUI client:

- Git commands built into your wiki client, personal knowledge manager (Obsidian and Obsidian Git), or source code IDE.
- [command line Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line).

Most Git GUI clients are built for developers, and focus on making complex commit and branch operations 



(could somebody fix this?)



- Git Extensions (Windows)
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com) (macOS)
- [Tower](https://git-tower.com/) (Windows and macOS)
