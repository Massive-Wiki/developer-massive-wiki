# Git GUI Clients

A Git GUI client is a graphical application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Git version control system. It helps users manage their repositories, visualize commit history, branches, and other Git-related tasks without having to use the command line.

Alternatives to a GUI client:

- Git commands built into your wiki client, personal knowledge manager (Obsidian and Obsidian Git), or source code IDE.
- [command line Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line).

Most Git GUI clients are built for developers, and focus on making complex commit and branch operations more visual and easier to manage.  As such, they may be more complex than many Massive Wiki users need; but the visual nature of the UI and the simplification of Git operations may be of use.

Here are some clients; this is an early and incomplete list in no particular order.

-  Sourcetree (Windows and macOS)
- GitHub Desktop (Windows and macOS)
- GitKraken (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- SmartGit (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- Git Extensions (Windows)
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com) (macOS)
- [Tower](https://git-tower.com/) (Windows and macOS)
