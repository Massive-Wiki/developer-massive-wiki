# Developer Wiki (Massive Wiki)

This is a wiki for [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) software and process developers and for those interested in Massive Wiki development.

For now, use the "All Pages", "Search", and other "Site Navigation" buttons to find your way around.

2024-10-19: Hypothesis annotation disabled for the nonce. (Click the "<" icon in the upper right to open the Hypothesis annotation/highlights panel.  Sign up or log into Hypothesis in that panel to add comments and annotations to the pages in this wiki.)

There is an "Edit on GitHub" button on pages that are open for editing.

There is a nascent [[Massive Wiki Roadmap]].
