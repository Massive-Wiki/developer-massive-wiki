I (Pete) am working on Webmention as part of IndieWebCamp San Diego 2023.

[Angelo](https://ragt.ag/) is graciously helping me by answering newbie questions. :-)

My first experiment is to use a service to send Webmentions; the services I've looked at will send a Webmention for links inside an `h-entry`.

The current plan is to wrap the whole body of wiki pages in `h-entry`; this page will be doing that.
