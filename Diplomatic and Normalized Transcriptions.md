# Diplomatic and Normalized Transcriptions

_First version created by copying in from Pete's local personal wiki, 2024-01-31_

In handwriting transcription, we have "diplomatic" transcription and "normalized" transcription.  (And semi-diplomatic and semi-normalized....)

"Diplomatic" transcription tries to copy the text exactly, with archaic orthography and what-have-you.

"Normalized" transcription tries to make the text readable by a modern reader.
