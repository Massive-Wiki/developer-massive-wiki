# 2022-10-24 Hugo markdown testing

This is an Obsidian note to observe what happens in Hugo to bulleted lists.  
- like this bullet item here
- and this other one
- and yet a third one following on
- without adding any spaces at the
- end of the lines; just CRs

## later that same day (2022-10-24)
- we add this page to developer wiki
- just to keep ourselves honest about what MWB does with un-ordered lists
- so this list only has CRs at the end of the lines

### but this list here
- has explicit two space characters  
- at the end of each line  
- which seems like a lot to ask  
- of the hapless folk just trying to  
- make a list.
