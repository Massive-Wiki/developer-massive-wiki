# 2022-10-24 some markdown testing

This is an Obsidian note to observe what happens in MWB when making bulleted (un-ordered) lists.  

- like this bullet item here
- and this other one
- and yet a third one following on
- without adding any spaces at the
- end of the lines; just CRs
- however, a blank line is needed before starting the list

## later that same day (2022-10-24)
- we add this page to developer wiki
- just to keep ourselves honest about what MWB does with un-ordered lists
- so this list only has CRs at the end of the lines

### but this list here
- has explicit two space characters  
- at the end of each line  
- which seems like a lot to ask  
- of the hapless folk just trying to  
- make a list.  

#### notes on what was observed
- a line of plain text followed by items with leading hyphens "-" are
  formatted by MWB as an HTML paragraph, not as an unordered list.
- one solution is to place a blank line between the sentence and the
  listed items. this is formatted as an un-ordered list.
- last observation: any kind of header can be followed by an
  un-ordered list, and list items can be terminated by CRs (i.e., no
  blank spaces are needed at the end of the list items)
