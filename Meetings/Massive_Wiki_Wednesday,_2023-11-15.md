## Next steps

Aim for a good release by end of year

- MWB -> MWP (or new name)
- add that "decentralized/distributed" explanation to the MW philosophy
    - here are the benefits, and we think they're worth it
    - note that there are costs
- do a plugin architecture? (someday)
- do PyPi module? (someday)
    - figure out the internal naming and structure
- do a nice English explanation of how MWP works? (someday)
- create a directory of massive wikis
    - make sure they're all updated
- propagate Bill's fix for All Pages chrono to the central distribution places
    - https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massivewikibuilder/commit/3533a5a1cde1b585b6e0dc72cca2096123b2288d

For the "do?" things, understand the motivation, the resources needed, the benefits gained.

## MWB / MWP names?

- short, doesn't have obvious meaning
