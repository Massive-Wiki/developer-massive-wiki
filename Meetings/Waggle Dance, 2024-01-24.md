## List from Jerry's Brain

- Create GPTs for Massive Wikis
    - starter cost: $
    - GPT and GPT-like platforms: OpenAI GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe.com
    - some "one-button" way to take the contents of a MW and set it up to turn it into a GPT
    - More generalized AI to have a conversation with a given corpus? Are these the same? 
        - What is the limit on model size? Can it handle 1 to 2 million words? 
    - If you don't have a GPT that goes with your book... 
- Make Massive Wiki More of a Wiki (editing from the Web interface)
    - starter cost (maquette that works, "Edit This Page" button that goes to the GitHub page for this file for editing): $$
    - making it nice: $$$ - $$$$
    - Inverse reationship between ease of use in starting up, and power... 99% of people reading web, don't know how to make a website or contribute to wiki... Most people don't want to edit - want to 1. comment 2. copy and post to blog and comment... 
    - Need essentially two interfaces... 
        - one for people who may want to edit...  
        - another for people who don't (99.99% of people - will find it difficult to conceptualize editing a page). Most never interact with text in a contributory way. 
    - also see "A Menu for Contributing to a Wiki Web Page" belowlad
- Themes for Massive Wiki
    - each simple theme: $, each advanced theme: $$
    - Childrens Book 
    - Text Book 
    - Documentation (that looks like software documentation websites)
- Make the NeoBook / Lionsberg Wiki Books Reading Experience Special
    - Beyond themes - what should the reading experience on the web be? 
    - Examples 
        - Chris Aldrich? 
        - Andy Matuschak?
- Ability to have distinct themes for a subset of the wiki
    - starter version: $$
- Better Interwiki
    - cross-wiki linking
    - cross-wiki transclusion
    - sister pages
    - viewing multiple wikis as one
    - $$ to have ideas 
    - $$$ to start 
    - $$$$ quickly 
    - Distinct themes for subsets (above) - is lower hanging fruit... 
    - Decentralizations - multiple communities talking to one another through the magic of wikis that can look separate or like one thing... 
    - similar in ways to the old blogosphere with pingbacks and trackbacks
- Issue of Canonicity and Decentralization and Quality... 
    - Navigation towards Truth
    - discussion space for each issue
    - hypernetwork
    - ways to hold separate truths at the same time, and for readers to vote or certify their views
    - Ability to separate out subsets of issues - and point and reference... 
        - The crystalization of things towards coherence and consensus... 
        - Kind of like honeybee democracy
        - Great noosphere
        - Interesting links to governance and decision making
        - Proxy voting and delegation of responsiblity and authority by domain... 
        - Dalios - Believability weighted idea meritocracy... 
- Managing NeoBook Metadata
    - standardized "tropes" like cut/copy/paste
- NeoBook Writing Dashboard
    - is this the scrivener-ish view+pages
- Path from Massive Wiki to ePub and KDP
- Publishing / ISBN #s etc. 
    - 
- Permalinks for Plex Post Articles
    - 1 page per post, one generated page that acts as the whole Plex publication
    - Ability to serialize publishing then combine later... 
- Podcast Infrastructure for Massive Wiki
- Present from a Wiki - NeoDeck
    - javascript presentation framework
- Storytelling with Massive Wiki
    - e.g. Prezi, along with other ways to assist narrative
    - c.f. a chatbot interface, which would include "tell me a story about..." within the corpus
- The OGM Multiplane Mosaic
    - Separating out levels of abstraction... moving between them... understanding what we are talking about where in the Salience Landscape...
    - [ladder of abstraction]( https://bra.in/9vBmPa)
    - Making a very important invisible / unconscious narrative framework conscious / visible so we can navigate the landscape of coneptualization together...
- [Opal](https://developer.massive.wiki/opal), a desktop / web / mobile front-end, or client, for Massive Wiki
    - supplants Obsidian+Git
    - makes Git easier, particularly
- [Zircon](https://developer.massive.wiki/zircon), a Massive Wiki frontend for Git forges 

Some of Pete and Bill's list of easy / important fixes and additions

- Separate Home Page template (or better, multiple page templates, choose which template with metadata in page)
    - starter version: $
- Fix Basso or create another theme where the sidebar (not the top nav) folds into a hamburger menu
    - starter version: $, nice version: $$
- Ship or replace Coriander (a non-framework-based theme)
- fix or close issues in <https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massivewikibuilder/issues>
