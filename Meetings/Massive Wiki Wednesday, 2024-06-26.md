## Summer 2024 Roadmap

- fold in "website root" code, so it works locally, on Netlify, and on GitHub Pages
- merge pytest code
- finish Dolce to v1 (footer and whatever), PK
- finish and document "Edit on $git_repo" button, PK
- move mainline dev work to nxc (which will have its name changed someday)
- clean up mwb repo issues list, port any keepers to the new repo
- code review everything
- find a name
- make landing page for module nice enough

## Thoughts

- move origin repo when we move to new name? codeberg? self-host Gitea?
