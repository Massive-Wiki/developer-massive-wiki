# Massive Wiki Wednesday, 2023-12-13

- we expect to rename "Massive Wiki Builder" to something shorter soon; front-runner is "MasWiki", runner-up is "Pyxis"
- shift to PyPI module for distributing the software, rather than Git submodules
- don't ship the whole theme library with the starter kit
- next year, consider working on:
    - permalink solutions (reconcile local folder convenience with web need for permalinks)
    - maybe move Git-for-beginners work to Prose Fusion?
    - develop and share more wiki best practices, ho-to, etc.
- off-topic: better messaging apps, Pete's idea about an email-based short-threaded-message network
