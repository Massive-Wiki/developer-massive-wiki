## MWB Bugs

- macos doesn't distinguish between case, linux does

## Ecosystem of Tools

- "Massive Wiki is a movement to create a wiki ecosystem (rather than just one engine) that provides classic wiki utility, with a plurality of tools and processes that enable decentralization and federation of the pages."
- sharing HackMD links - https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/H1XK1opXo/both?edit

## Obsidian v1.0 Released

- new setting for file header
    - recommend turning off "Show inline title" (Displays the filename as an editable title inline with the file contents.) and continue to use the `# Page Title` convention
    - consider using "Page Heading From Links" community plugin
- don't need separate "Collapse All" plugin any more

## "Working Notes" / "Management" pages in Massive Wiki

### Options

1. create a feature request for a way to flag pages or entire folder(s) that don't get published to the web
2. create an "Internal Pages" section of your site, with an explanatory section home page explaining what "internal pages" are; maybe add a header at the top of each page
3. for super-clean websites, have a staging wiki website, and a production website
    - with Git branches
    - with two separate repos

# 404 page
* build phase: 404.md solution, mentioning that we're upgrading to a 'auto-stub creation' process.
* example: Lionsberg: https://lionsberg.wiki/404.md

# homepage spidergraph proposal
* put interactive form into later project phase
