## PyPI communities

For advice on architecture and publishing PyPI (Python Package Index) modules, we might explore the following communities:

- Stack Overflow: A large community of developers where you can ask specific questions about your module's architecture and the process of publishing to PyPI. Use tags like python, pypi, and package to reach the right audience.
- Reddit: Subreddits like r/Python or r/learnpython can be good places to seek advice. There are many experienced developers in these communities who can offer insights and guidance.
- Python Forums: The official Python forums (discuss.python.org) have a special category for packaging where you can discuss PyPI-related topics and get advice from experienced package maintainers.
- PyPI's own documentation and community: PyPI provides comprehensive guides and documentation on how to create, distribute, and publish packages. They also have a community and support channels where you can ask for help.
- Python community channels on IRC or Discord: Channels dedicated to Python development can be valuable for real-time advice and discussion.
    - https://discord.com/invite/python (Python Discord)
    - https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-discord-server/ (additional Discord servers)

Places we won't explore for now:

- GitHub: If you have a repository for your module, engaging with the GitHub community can be beneficial. You can get feedback through issues or discussions within your repository.
- Meetups and Conferences: Attending local Python meetups or conferences (like PyCon) can provide you with the opportunity to network with other Python developers and discuss your project for more in-depth feedback.
