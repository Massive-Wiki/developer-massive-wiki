# Start a Massive Wiki - how-to


A Massive Wiki supports the sharing of versions of files in Markdown format. Markdown, Shared, Versioned, Files led to an acronym, MaSVF, that is pronounced like the word "Massive". A Massive Wiki is a collection of files in markdown format that can contain links to each other and to other resources both local and on the internet.

Establishing and using a Massive Wiki starts with answering a few questions.

**First**: what software apps will be used to write and edit Markdown Files? One app that supports Markdown and inter-file linking is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). There are several other well-supported apps, including Logseq, Visual Studio Code, and plain text editors such as Emacs, Vim, Notepad++, ??  
 - TODO: clarify this list and include links

**Second**: how will wiki files be shared and versioned? One way to do this is to use a Git-based system, such as [GIthub](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org). Our current primary wiki practice uses Github. Git services manage the versioning of wiki files well; sharing practices need to be established for each wiki. We have suggestions.  
 - TODO: link to these suggestions

With these two questions answered a Massive Wiki can be created and put into practice. One further question remains.

**Third**: will this wiki be published to the World-Wide Web? The Massive Wiki team provides a publication method, Massive Wiki Builder, that renders the content of the wiki as a static web site. Enabling this can be managed by Github for a GIthub wiki repository, or by another hosting service such as [Netlify](https://netlify.app).
